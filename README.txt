Hi, 

I made this website for my girlfriend asking her to be my valentine.
I'm self-taught and everything here is just stuff i picked up and learnt picking apart
other peoples code and alot of trial and error.

I aim to make my work from here beginner friendly to help alot of new coders to share this journey with me. 
Specifically in this code i've added text lines briefly mentioning what a set line of code is doing i've added some extra 
images and sounds feel free to use your own (make sure to update the file path in the html and JS)

remember classes are used to identify what you want to edit within CSS - that's how i edited the boxes surrounding the txt, the buttons and images all at once
the id's are needed to identify them within the javascript helping me identiy when i need a text hidden, when i want a text to show, how clicking the yes button should 
start playing a sound, stop playing a sound when the other button is clicked etc

There may have been quicker ways and shortcuts but to learn everything must be broken down 
so hopefully the code is easy to follow along to!

Thanks, Ares <3

valentine
